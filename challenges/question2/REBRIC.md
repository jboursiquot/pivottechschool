# Database
Implement a query that produces the specified output. Column names in the first row of the output don't need to match exactly.

## Language
PostgreSQL (v14.2)

## Testing
The output of your code will be compared to the expected output.

## Verdicts
After you submit your code for testing, the following verdicts are possible:

Compilation/syntax error - This means you probably have some syntax errors in your source code. More detailed information will be given along with the verdict to help you identify the issue.

Execution error - This means your code has crashed. Most likely, it crashes only for some input parameters. More detailed information will be given along with the verdict to help you identify the issue.

Compilation time exceeded - This verdict happens rarely, mostly for C++ or Java. This means that your code is either too long or you overused templates, which results in very slow compilation of your code.

Execution time limit exceeded - This means that your code didn't finish executing within the given time limit. It either got hung up on one of the test cases, or it just works very slowly. It's likely that your solution is either not optimally efficient, or you have a bug in the code.

Output limit exceeded - This verdict happens rarely. It means that either your function return value size is too big (e.g. you returned a very big array or matrix), or that you overused console outputs and essentially spammed it with a lot of data. One possible cause of such an issue is that you have a console output inside an infinite loop.

Wrong answer - This verdict means that your code was compiled and ran successfully, but it returned an incorrect output for one or more test cases. More detailed information will be provided to help you diagnose the issue.

All tests passed - This means that your code works correctly and passed all the tests within the given time limit.
